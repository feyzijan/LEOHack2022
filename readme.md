# LEOHack 2022
This is a repository for all the code written for the LEOHack 2022 competition run by ICRS and ICSS. This contains both the code to run the actual satellites and a simulator.

# Update self.challenge_no variable in team_controller.py team_init() function 

# My solution to the Challenge:
- Explanations to be written

PID control with additional Damping Term:




Offset:



Challenge Specific Tuning:
For each challenge the parameters Kp,Ki,Kd,Kdy and K can be changed.
If steady state errors can't be adequately eliminated through the use of these parameters, additional small offsets may be added to the x,y,theta offsets.



Challenge Performance:
Challenge 1 Passed
Challenge 2: Passed
Challenge 3: Fail
Challenge 4: Passed


Adherence to Challenge Constraints
