# LEOHack 2022
This is a repository for all the code written for the LEOHack 2022 competition run by ICRS and ICSS ( Imperial Robotics and Space Society's).
This contains both the code to run the actual satellites and a simulator.

There are also design files for the physical challenge.

 *** Update self.challenge_no variable in team_controller.py team_init() function 


# My solution to the Challenge:
- Explanations present in commented code

Challenge Specific Tuning:
For each challenge the parameters Kp,Ki,Kd,Kdy and K can be changed.
If steady state errors can't be adequately eliminated through the use of these parameters, additional small offsets may be added to the x,y,theta offsets.


Challenge Performance:
Challenge 1 Passed
Challenge 2: Passed
Challenge 3: Fail
Challenge 4: Passed
